App that retrieves a listing of Java Developers in Nairobi using the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-users).

## Design

The design mockup is for the following pages:

1. [Developers list](./art/wireframes/Developers.png).
2. [Developer profile](./art/wireframes/Profile.png).
3. [Share profile](./art/wireframes/Share.png).

Try out the [interactive design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/29abd095-a127-41b9-49bf-aaecbbc9f0ad-5f9a/).

The design was based off [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) and created using [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/africa/products/xd.html), a free and effective tool that also allows publishing one's design as well as testing the design with ease on a Smart Phone.
